  <h1>Welcome to this site!</h1>
  <p>The main goal of this site is to inform the reader upon the major misconseptions involving science.
  This is a work in progress. The structure of the site will probably be changed a lot</p>
  <a href="#">Learn More</a>
  <p>Here are some topics that will be discussed</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What is science exactly</li>
    <li>Science and religion (this will be a personal view)</li>
    <li>Science versus fake science</li>
    <li>Science and the media</li>
  </ul>
  <p>There are also some thing I would like to give some backround information on. I think this will help you understand why 
  some general misconseptions arise (by lowering your general ignorance). The topics will be focussed on topics I know alot about</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Genetics</li>
    <li>Chemisty</li>
    <li>Big-Data</li>
  </ul>
